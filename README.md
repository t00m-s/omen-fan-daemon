# omen-fan-daemon
This project is a rewrite of https://github.com/alou-S/omen-fan

Why?
- I wanted to add systemd service instead of running it every time I opened my laptop.
- I saw a PR that even after a year was completey ignored, so I assumed that the project was dead.
## Optional goals
- Create an arch build script to push this in AUR.
